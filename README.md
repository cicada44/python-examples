# Python3 Trivial Examples for Pupils

This repository contains a collection of trivial Python 3 examples aimed at helping pupils learn the basics of programming. The examples cover various concepts such as variables, conditions, loops, functions, input/output, arrays, basic types, classes, and more.

## Program Examples

The `programs` directory contains the following Python programs:

- [evenOddDetector.py](programs/evenOddDetector.py): A program that determines whether a given number is even or odd.
- [findGreatestOfThreeNums.py](programs/findGreatestOfThreeNums.py): A program that finds the greatest among three given numbers.
- [sum.py](programs/sum.py): A program that calculates the sum of two numbers.

## Theory Examples

The `theory` directory contains the following Python code examples:

- [arrays.py](theory/arrays.py): Example usage of arrays in Python.
- [basicTypes.py](theory/basicTypes.py): Examples demonstrating the usage of basic data types in Python.
- [classes.py](theory/classes.py): Examples showcasing the implementation of classes and objects.
- [comments.py](theory/comments.py): Examples demonstrating the usage of comments in Python code.
- [conditions-01.py](theory/conditions-01.py): Examples illustrating the usage of conditional statements in Python.
- [conditions-02.py](theory/conditions-02.py): Continuation to conditions-01.py.
- [cycleFor.py](theory/cycleFor.py): Examples demonstrating the usage of `for` loops in Python.
- [cycleWhile.py](theory/cycleWhile.py): Examples illustrating the usage of `while` loops in Python.
- [functions.py](theory/functions.py): Examples showcasing the implementation and usage of functions in Python.
- [input.py](theory/input.py): Examples demonstrating different methods of accepting user input in Python.
